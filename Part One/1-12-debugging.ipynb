There are three types of coding errors:\n\n    * Syntax error: It means a Python interpreter in the process of analyzing or more precisely parsing the code, fails to be able to generate executable program. \n    * Runtime error: It occurs when Python detects some illegal operations when the code is already running. Python will stop running when runtime error occurs unless explicitly be instructed what to do by the code.\n    * Logic error: It refers to the situation when a program can successful finish but its outcome is not expected. This often indicates some design problems of the code logic itself.\n\n\nToday we are going to focus on the first two errors, and we will not spend time to discuss logic error, which is a much bigger topic we should revisit as we discuss specific algorithms later in the course. In this lecture, we will also not able to cover every type of syntax and runtime errors. Instead, we will focus on the most commonly encountered errors, especially for those who are at the beginner and intermediate levels of Python programming.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Syntax Error\n\nIn the following, we will cause Python to generate syntax errors when checking the code, and will comment on how to prevent them.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Declare a code block\n\nfor i in range(20)\n    print(i)\nelse\n    pass","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"One of the most common syntax errors is missing colons to indicate the beginning of a new code block.

First, according to the variable name *List*, it seems the programmer wants to define a *list* type. However, the use of paratheses actually defines a tuple. Then in the second statement, the code attempts to assign the first element of *List* to the second. In the setting that *List* actually is a tuple and immutable, this assignment is illegal. Therefore, to fully fulfill the programmer's original design, *List* needs to be defined using sqare brackets, and also referencing a list element also shall use square brackets.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":" # Use indentation\n\n x = 0\n    while x<10:\n        x = x + 1\n            print(x)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The sample code above emphasizes the importance of understanding properly using indentation in Python. Different from many other high-level languages such as C++ and Java, Python enforces the format of using indentations in the code. First, for the statements that belong to the top-level code block, they shall not have any indentation at all. The above statement \"x = 0\" adds a single space in the front, which leads to **IndentationError**. \n\nThe second place where indentation is not properly used is inside the *while* loop, where statements belonging to the same code block should have the same indentation. In the code, the statements *x = x + 1* and *print(x)* have different amounts of indentation, which also leads to **IndentationError**.

This is another type of syntax error where a class object does not support a function. In particular for the *str* type, it is immutable. Therefore, an internal method cannot change the variable value. To this end, reversing a string can be done by reversely assigning the string characters to a new string variable, as\n\n    new_string = String[::-1]","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Using built-in operators\n\nString = 'abcd'\nString = String + 'abcd'\n\nList = ['abcd']\nList = List + 'abcd'","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Similarly, we should pay attention about how built-in methods and operators are defined. In the above code, we first can see the \"+\" operator when defined by the *str* type deals with the concatenation of two strings of the same type. Similarly, the \"+\" operator when defined by the *list* type deals with the concatenation of two lists. Therefore, concatenating a list and a str will generate **TypeError**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# variable naming convention\nanimals = ['dog', 'cat', 'pony', 'fish', 'leopard', 'rabbid', 'mouse']\nprint(Animals[0])","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above example shows another most popular synatx error, namely, using undefined variable name. In this case, the code did not pay attention that the variable name *animals* in the assignment statement is all small capitals. Although it is fairly easy to detect the error in the above example, it may not be so obvious in large projects. Therefore, creating variables or classes following a naming convention can effectively mitigate the risk of encountering NameError.\n\nFor variable naming, the most straightforward convention is that:\n\n    * Variables should be all small cap, with unabridged words that best describe its purpose connected in a phrase by underlines \"_\".\n    * Constant values should be all capitals, with unabridged words that best describe its purpose connected in a phrase by underlines \"_\".\n    * Class names should also use unabridged words, but should capitalize the first letter of every word.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use of quotation marks\nwrong_string = 'Mike's story'\nprint(wrong_string)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above SyntaxError clearly is caused by incorrect use of quotation marks when defining a string variable.

Only when a runtime error occurs, then Python interpreter will catch the error and interrupt the program's execution, unless the interruption is handled also by the program. In the rest of the lecture, we will continue to examine some of the most typical runtime errors, and then discuss a new conditional statement specifically for catching runtime errors, called *try -- except -- else*.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'pony', 'fish', 'leopard', 'rabbid', 'mouse']\nprint(animals[7])","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above code generates **IndexError**, which indicates the list index is out of range.

When we code our own custom function, it is a practice to always double check the types and values of the input arguments.

The *finally* statement, if exists in the *try -- except -- else* combination, follows either *except* or *else* code blocks, and its code block is the last code block to be executed after the program enters the *try* code block.\n\nAn important rule to remember for *finally* is that Python requires the *finally* code block, again if exists, must be executed at the end of the *try* combination. Even if the code flow exits from within the *try* block, the *execpt* block, or the *else* block, the *finally* code block must be executed.","metadata":{}}]}
